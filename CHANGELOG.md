# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

For the purpose of determining breaking changes:

- Only direct imports from top-level module `unpaginate` are considered public API
- A change that only impacts type hints validation is not considered a breaking change
- Removing support for a version of Python that is not [officially
  supported][python-versions] anymore is not considered a breaking change
